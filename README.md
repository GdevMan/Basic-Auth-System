# Basic-Auth-System
A basic authentication system written in python for testing

# How to use:
1. Git clone the repo or download ```auth.py```
2. Tweak it as you wish (Example: add bcrypt, implement it to your code/project) or just run it
# NOTE:
- This program **DOES NOT HAVE ENCRYPTION, HASHING OR ANY OTHER SECURITY SYSTEM**!
- For this to be production ready it **NEEDS** hashing or encryption **AT LEAST**
- This is an example/minmal authentication system
